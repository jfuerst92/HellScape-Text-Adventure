With all of these files in one direcroty simply run: python play.py

It runs, but is missing a lot of features. rooms are initialized, player, reaper, items are set. features are not implemented yet.

Currently supported commands include:

look

look <item>

look <feature>

pickup <item>

drop <item>

go <room>

you'll need to look at the code to find out what items are in what room. there is a doru in the room the player starts in, so you 
can experiment with that item immediately

all rooms still have the placeholder text until that gets changed, so you can only type go Limbo and it will take you to another
room that is adjacent. This needs refining, since the player will probably not know the names of the adjecent rooms. THe user will
probably have to interact with a feature like a door in order to change rooms, but thats something for later.

Beyond this, we can simply start adding features on to this, unless there's some critical gameplay functionality that wont work with
this. If so, let me know and we can rework it. No support for the animation stuff yet. I figure that will be the next step.
