You enter the graveyard and take a look at the gravestones, many of which are festively adorned.  You read the inscriptions on the stones
as you walk past:
    'His wife's cooking really is to die for!  Johnny B. Goode' 
    'He was the life of the party!  George Donner'
    'R.I.P. Player A. the 1st'
Why it's  your great, great, great, great, great, great grandfather, Player A. The First!
