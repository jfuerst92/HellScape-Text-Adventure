You approach a small stall and are surprised to discover that the merchant is in fact a skeleton. The skeleton does not seem the least bit perturbed
by your appearance.  "Welcome to the afterlife," he intones, "here you can spend the rest of your days having a huge fiesta with all of your deceased 
relatives, if you choose to stay. Or, if you're just a tourist you can check out my wares."


 He then begins his sales spiel:
   "Welcome to Kel's Spice Rack!
    Our prices can't be beat!  
    The world famous Cemetary Rock Salt can be had for the low, low price of only five gold coins!
    Or how about some Cajun Voodoo Spice Mix for a mere three gold coins?

    Well, what can I do for you?
