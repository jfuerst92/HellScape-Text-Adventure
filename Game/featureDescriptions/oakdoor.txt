There is a large oak door that looks to be incredibly old. You can see that termites and other creatures have made this door their home. Regardless, it is quite sturdy, and hardly moves when you press into it. There is an iron handle midway up the door. You try to put the brown and red stains on it out of your mind. Looks like the employees here don't wash their hands...
