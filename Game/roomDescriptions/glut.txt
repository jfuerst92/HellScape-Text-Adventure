You enter a massive canvern with a rocky ceiling so high you can see dark clouds above your head. These clouds are filling this monstrous cavern with 
torrents of rain. This rain is responsible for the ankle-deep mud that you have to make your way through, slowly but surely. To the left you see muddy 
hills stretching off into the distance and to your right the same you see a similar landscape. In the valleys between these hills you see mounds of 
human waste and worming their way through these mounds are giant, bus-sized worms gorging insatiably. Suddenly. you realize that covering the hills are 
souls rolling the mud and excrement. All around these souls you see fat, gluttonous pigs sitting and gorging on the waste around them. It appears these 
souls are damned to a miserable existence of forever being covered in their own excrement.
