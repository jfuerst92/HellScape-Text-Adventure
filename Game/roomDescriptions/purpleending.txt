   You find yourself in the plain room with the three people you had previously met.  "This oughtn't bee too bad," you think to 
yourself.  "No undead, and they seem normal and pleseant enough company."  
   "Hi everyone," you declare to the room at large.  The three stangers look up at you briefly and then look away, seemingly 
resuming their internal dialogues.  You feel a bit flabbergasted by their response.  "No, I am not a coward..." you hear Joseph 
murmur to himself before trailing off.  "Of course you aren't, Joe.  Come with me and we can redeem ourselves," says Estelle.  
Nes begins to laugh sardonically to himself, and starts a quick monologue.  You catch the phrases, "assuming a role", "nothingness 
in the heart of being", and "existence preceeding essense."  
   These three nutjobs are beginning to drive you crazy, and you shout, "Let me out of this hellhole!"
   The door opens but you find yourself completely unable to walk out the door.  You look on in a horror that transforms into 
despair as the door slowly closes of its own accord.  Your realize that you are going to be stuck in the midst of this 
existential melodrama for the rest of eternity.
