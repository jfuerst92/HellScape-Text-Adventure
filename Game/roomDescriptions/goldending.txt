   You find yourself at the banquent hall you had encountered earlier.  You feel famished and so you rip in to the ham shank in front
of you.  The meat practically drips off the bone.  This is the most amazing thing you have ever eaten.  You grab a goblet form the 
table and wash the meat down with a swig of mead.  Like the ham, it is absolutely delicious. 
   After hours of feasting, you realize that each bite tastes as magnificent as the last and you don't seem to be getting full.  
Clearly, this is the best of all possible afterlifes.
   Suddenly, a loud horn begins to blow.  All of your fellow revelers rise hurriedly from their seats and head to the end of the hall.  
You follow behind them, confused at this new turn of events.  You catch up to them and see that they are in an armory that puts any 
Hollywood recreation to shame.  They are donning pieces of armor and weighing weapons in a very serious manner.  "What's going on?" 
you ask.  They reply with a single word, "Ragnarok".  Just then, the roof is torn from the armory and you see a snake the size of a 
skyscraper rear back it's head, ready to strike.  

   You didn't sign up for this $*!#.
