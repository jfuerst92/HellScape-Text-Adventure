You enter a cavernous room and see the devil, the Lord of Lies himself, in all his infernal glory.
"Welcome to your own personal hell, aldsfa. Before you lie five doors, each leading to
a special hell. Go, explore the hells, and return to me when you have decided the hell you wish to
suffer until the end of time."

You see the following doors standing in front of you, seemingly attached to nothing:
pinkdoor: A multihued door decorated with skulls and crosses
greendoor: What looks like an ordinary, lime-colored, apartment door
yellowdoor: A door made out of what appears to be sandstone
golddoor: A large wooden door decorated with gems and inlaid with gold designs
purpledoor: Another seemingly ordinary door. This one is a light shade of purple, and has no adornments other than a handle
