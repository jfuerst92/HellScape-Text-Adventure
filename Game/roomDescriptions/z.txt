   You find yourself standing in what appears to be a normal apartment unit.  You are standing in the entranceway to the apartment,
and see a kitchen to your left, a living room straight ahead of you, and a wall with two closed doors on your right.
   The living room has all of the standard comforts of the modern living room.  There is a large, beige couch with its back to you.
Opposite the couch is a large flatscreen TV sitting on a wooden table.  On the wall of the living room is a large antique mirror.
The windows seem a bit heavily barred.  Perhaps this home is in a bad neighborhood.
   The kitchen is dimly lit, but also appears rather normal, other than its state of disaray.  There are dishes and silverware 
strewn about the tabletop.  There is a large, dark, liquid stain on the floor.  The rancid smell of rotting vegetables hits your 
nose, but is not able to mask the smell of something quite appetizing.
   You hear what sounds like wimpering coming from one of the doors to your right.
