   You awaken as a majestic Pharoah, surrounded by all of the luxuries afforded a god-king.  You feel power surging from your fingertips.
You point at one of the urns and a bolt of light flashes from your fingertips, instantly vaporizing the urn.  You begin to cackle at your 
newfound power, in a voice that resonates like a thousand watt amp.  "I will rule this world," you declare, "and all who inhabit it shall 
worship me."  
   "Not so fast," says an interloper who looks suspiciously like Brendan Fraser as he points a World War II era pistol at you. "You think 
a mere human weapon can stop me?" you chortle as you send a ball of energy his way. 'Brendan' manages to roll out of the way of your blast 
and in one continuous motion aims and fires his gun at you.
   The bullet is pulverized as it hits your chest.  You barely feel a think.  "Pitiful creature, what did you think that would accomplish? 
I now have powers well beyond your imagining," you begin to monologue.  Suddenly, a set of bandages appears in the air and begin to wrap 
themselves about you.  You try to pull them off, but their stength is somehow even mightier than your own.  
   "Noooooo," you sceam, "with these powers I could have done anything!"  The bandages completely envelop you and you feel yourself being 
lifted in the air.  You are dropped into a sarcophagus and hear the heavy lid grinding into place.  You hear the whoops of celebration of
your opponent, and hear his footsteps retreating into the distance.  
   You are now lying in complete silence, in what you imagine must be your eternal resting place, contemplating the rest of your afterlife.
It is at this moment that you nose begins to itch.   

  							 --THE END--
