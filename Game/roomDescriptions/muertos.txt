   You are immediately blinded by a bright light.  You feel a pleasant warmth suffuse your body and are just able to make out what sounds like a brass
section.  You also faintly hear the murmur of many chitinous voices, as though some strange human-insect mutation was speaking.  Oddly, the voices sound 
rather pleasant.    
   After several minutes, your eyes begin to adjust and you find yourself in a brightly lit plazza.  You stand on a cobblestone road that stretches 
out indefinitely, and notice what looks like a graveyard in the far distance.  Both sides of the street are covered with multihued stalls covered with 
skulls and coffins.  Despite the macabre decor, you feel a certain sense of gaiety about the place.
