	Suddenly, a bright light begins to glow all around you.  The beating heart, the working brain, and the spectral spirit rise into the 
air and begin to twirl around rapidly.   

	"Nooooooo," you hear Beelzebub shout from somewhere far off in the distance.

	The heart, brain, and spirit begin to move faster and faster around you and soon all you can see is a wall of light.  

	The light grows so intense that you begin to feel disoriented.  You are forced to cover your eyes with your hands, lest you be blinded.

	After indeterminable period of time, you notice sounds around your.  You hear what sounds like the chirping of birds. You open your eyes
to discover that you are in a small clearing in an evergreen forest.  You feel the pleasant warmth of the sun on your skin and, for what seems 
like the first time in years, feel alive.  Off in the distance you notice a small wooden cabin, just like you've always dreamed of owning.  You
know that inside will be the large bookshelf filled with all off the books you've loved and those you wish to read, beside a brick fireplace.  
You realize that you have been given a second chance at life, and plan to live life to the fullest, know fully realizing that any day could be
your last.
