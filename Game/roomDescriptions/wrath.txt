You are ushered onto a giant boat that is filled with souls but the center of attention is the demon that is covered in flames at the front of the boat, guiding it through the toxic marsh around you. As this demon, whose name you come to find out is Phlegyas, guides the boat through the marsh, souls on the boat began to get angry at each other, leading to fights breaking out all around. The souls begin to fall off of the edge of the boat into the murky waters where they would continue to struggle against each other. The more the souls wrestled, the deeper they sank into the marsh water, eventually drowning them. This occurred over and over as souls fought over the sides of the boat, unaware that their anger toward each other would lead to their demise.
