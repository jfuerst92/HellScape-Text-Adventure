The rocky path stretches out ahead of you and you notice that it leads to a massive bridge that appears to be carved out of rock. Along the path and 
lining the bridge are golden statues of naked figures in various poses. As you scan the various figures, you realize that the air around you is swirling 
in violent circles. The violent air is driven by a raging storm above the rock bridge where purple lightning would come crashing down on the golden 
statues. You get a closer look at these figures in various positions and realize that they are souls trapped in a golden layering where they would be 
repeatedlly struck by the clamoring purple lightning. All around you the phallic-shaped mountains give you a feeling of being drawn toward the bridge. 
You also see what appears to be a large wooden key behind the nearest statue.
