In this level, you notice that you are in a giant hall where a molten, golden river flows all around the edges of the path. Souls stood in a line 
waiting to climb up wooden stairs that led to a higher level. On this level, the souls would be grabbed by a three-armed beast that would then chuck 
them into the molten gold below. Screaming could be heard from the souls as they boiled in the golden rivers that flowed away from the platform. You 
suddenly realize a large golden statue of a double-faced god-like figure loomed in the corner of the hall, larger than almost everything around it.
