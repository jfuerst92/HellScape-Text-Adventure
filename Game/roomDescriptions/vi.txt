You can see rivers of boiling blood and gnarled trees, while flakes of flame fall from the sky. More suffering, this time for the soulds of the violent. Warlords, murderes, sodomites, and blasphemers all endure 
their punishment in the burning blood. Those who have commited suicide are turned into trees who are constantly feasted upon by hellish harpies.
